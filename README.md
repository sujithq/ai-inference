Use AI models from [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) in
your workflows.

## Usage

Create a workflow to use the AI inference action:

```yaml
name: 'AI inference'
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  inference:
    permissions:
      models: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test Local Action
        id: inference
        uses: actions/ai-inference@v1
        with:
          prompt: 'Hello!'

      - name: Print Output
        id: output
        run: echo "${{ steps.inference.outputs.response }}"
```

## Inputs

Various inputs are defined in [`action.yml`](action.yml) to let you configure
the action:

| Name            | Description                                                                                                                           | Default                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `token`         | Token to use for inference. Typically the GITHUB_TOKEN secret                                                                         | `github.token`                       |
| `prompt`        | The prompt to send to the model                                                                                                       | N/A                                  |
| `system-prompt` | The system prompt to send to the model                                                                                                | `""`                                 |
| `model`         | The model to use for inference. Must be available in the [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace?type=models) catalog          | `gpt-4o`                             |
| `endpoint`      | The endpoint to use for inference. If you're running this as part of an org, you should probably use the org-specific Models endpoint | `https://models.github.ai/inference` |
| `max-tokens`    | The max number of tokens to generate                                                                                                  | 200                                  |

## Outputs

The AI inference action provides the following outputs:

| Name       | Description                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| `response` | The response from the model |

## Required Permissions

In order to run inference with GitHub Models, the GitHub AI inference action
requires `models` permissions.

```yml
permissions:
  contents: read
  models: read
```

## Publishing a New Release

This project includes a helper script, [`script/release`](./script/release)
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions. For more information, see
[Versioning](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent SemVer release tag of the current branch, by looking at the local data
   available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the tag retrieved in
   the previous step, and validates the format of the inputted tag (vX.X.X). The
   user is also reminded to update the version field in package.json.
1. **Tagging the new release:** The script then tags a new release and syncs the
   separate major tag (e.g. v1, v2) with the new release tag (e.g. v1.0.0,
   v2.1.2). When the user is creating a new major release, the script
   auto-detects this and creates a `releases/v#` branch for the previous major
   version.
1. **Pushing changes to remote:** Finally, the script pushes the necessary
   commits, tags and branches to the remote repository. From here, you will need
   to create a new release in GitHub so users can easily reference the new tags
   in their workflows.
